    <p>At File Converter Pro, your privacy is of the utmost importance to us. Our policy is to protect your personal information, and we do not collect any personally identifiable information from you.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We may collect some general, non-personal information through tools like Google Analytics to improve our service. This includes browser type, visitor counts, and popular pages.</p>

    <h3>File Handling</h3>
    <p>The files you upload for conversion are stored temporarily on our servers only for the duration of the conversion process. Once the conversion is complete, the files are automatically and permanently deleted. We do not store your files permanently or share them with any third parties.</p>

    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <p>To keep our service free, we use third-party advertising partners (like Adsterra and Google AdSense). These ad providers may use cookies and web beacons to serve ads based on your Browse history. They have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their data collection practices.</p>
